### Initial questions 
1. Do you have specific learning outcomes or assessments in place to measure participant success? (e.g., a final prototype, quiz, peer-review, etc.)
2. Will this course be delivered in-person, remotely, or as a hybrid? Some content, like hands-on labs, may need adaptation for virtual delivery.
3. The course references tools like pgVector, Docker, and proprietary IDEs—should we assume participants will have admin rights and the ability to install software on their machines?
4. The Advanced Modules mention a “project that evolves across both days.” Would you like help designing this as a capstone-style mini-project, with milestones and deliverables?
5. The ethics content is brief—do you envision expanding it to cover topics like bias, explainability, data privacy, etc.? Or is brevity intentional due to time constraints?
6. The mention of “post-training consultation” is great. Would you like templated follow-up documents or email cadences to help organizations continue development?

The answers to your questions are as follows:
1. I don't have _yet_ an assessment, but that is a very good point. We will work together on creating a Next.js app for evaluating the knowledge
2. The course will (most likely) be delivered both in-person and remotely. You are right, we will update the materials for some hands-on labs to be usable in both delivery types
3. Yes. They will be asked to install them before the course
4. Yes, definitely. We will use an internal chat-bot for a company, used to answer questions from a series of (simple) documents
5. Definitely. I will upload the materials for all the sessions, so that we can review them thoroughly
6. Yes, definitely; both - templated follow-up documents and email templates, with cadences

### A Few Additional Questions to Guide the Next Steps
1. What’s the expected number of participants per session? (Helps tailor labs and support formats)
2. Will participants work solo or in teams for hands-on labs? (Impacts how we design collaborative exercises)
3. Do you want to include any certification or completion credential at the end?
4. For the internal chatbot capstone, do you already have example documents or mock content we can use for prototyping?

The answers to your questions are as follows:
1. It will always vary; between 3 and 10-12+, most likely. Even more importantly - they will always have different knowledge and comprehension levels. We will tailor the materials to be accessible for all
2. Both solo and in teams. We will design both type of exercises, depending on their complexity and allocated times
3. Not for now. Later on, we will design a completion diploma, with a nice generated image
4. No, because the business domain of each participating group will vary. We will consider a chatbot for an online flight tickets store, as everyone likes to travel and it has a manageable complexity

Quick Final Questions Before Refinement
1. How would you like to structure the team labs? For example:
    Small group breakout tasks with shared repos?
    Rotating roles (prompter, integrator, tester)?
    Single shared repo with modular parts?

2. What balance of theory vs. implementation are you targeting in the Advanced Modules?
    (Still around 30/70 like the Core, or more implementation-heavy?)

3. Would you like lightweight pre-course self-check or quiz?
    (To assess prior AI understanding and help group participants accordingly)

The answers to your questions are as follows:
1. Small groups, with shared repos
2. More implementation-heavy, as they will have the foundation knowledge, at that stage
3. Yes, that will be great. We will create a short quiz to be used at the beginning of the course 

One area in which we will work - creating a series of
